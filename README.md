# Trivia-Brew!
This application was the first project for the UMN Coding Bootcamp. The application combines a geolocator using the Google Maps/Places API's to find a nearby bar or brewery and a trivia API to start a trivia game once your arrive!

## Geolocator

The geolocator will fire after pressing the "find my location" button and accepting the prompt. Then you can press the "where am I drinkin'" button to find nearby places to meet your friends!

The application will start with the first player entered and subsequently increment through all the other players after 5 question. <br>
Each player can choose a difficulty level for their questions and recieve points for correct answers. Harder questions are worth more points!
<li>Easy questions = 1 point
<li>Medium questions = 2 points
<li>Hard Questions = 3 points
